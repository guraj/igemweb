# igem-at-berkeley-web

**This is the repo for the current iGEM at Berkeley website, found [here](https://igem.berkeley.edu).**

## For developers

After cloning the repo, install Hugo to get started on working on the site. For macOS, run
~~~
brew install hugo
~~~
or
~~~
port install hugo
~~~
depending on your package manager of choice. For Windows installation instructions or troubleshooting, follow the guide [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing). To verify that the installation worked, run
~~~
hugo version
~~~


Now, you should be ready to start developing. In the "igem-at-berkeley-web" directory you cloned, run
~~~
hugo server
~~~
while you're editing the site to see the changes you're making reflected locally (usually at localhost:1313 in your browser of choice).
