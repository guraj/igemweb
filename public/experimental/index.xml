      <description>Cellyse aims to implement an antibody-inducible system of cell lysis in a bacterium in hopes of increasing accessibility and affordability to antibody diagnostics. Our system utilizes the T4 phage cell lysis mechanism and a visible color change to clearly indicate the presence of a specific antibody in a non-invasive saliva sample.</description>

      <description>Fungal contamination of soft cheeses, such as feta, poses a significant problem for organic cheese farms, resulting in major economic losses, potential health hazards from fungal mycotoxins, and quality reduction due to unnatural odors and flavors.</description>

      <description>Manually updating and curating data on reactions from scientific literary is difficult and involves human curation. Our project integrates natural language processing, chem informative, and XX to automate this process and ensure valid chemical reactions are being extracted.</description>

      <description>Our project focuses on creating a faster and more efficient way to perform traditional cloning methods. As opposed to traditional plasmid assembly methods that are performed in vitro, we aim to create a method that negates the need for plating in-between assembly steps.</description>

      <title>Clonebots Deletion</title>

      <description>The Clonebot Deletion teamâ€™s mission is to develop a more efficient way to knockout genes in bacteria. To do so, we are focusing on designing and cloning our way to a one-step plasmid system that cuts, trims, ligates, and self-clears with great accuracy using CRISPR-Cas12a.</description>
