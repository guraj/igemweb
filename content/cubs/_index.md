### Get ready to present your BioE research!

> iGEM at Berkeley is excited to bring you CUBS Spring 2023, the fourth semesterly symposium featuring the latest undergraduate-led BioE research. This semester, CUBS will be on **May 1, 2023**. For those interested in presenting at CUBS Spring 2023, please keep checking this site and [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/igematberkeley/) for a timeline.

> In the meantime, see our Abstract Formatting Guidelines below to help prepare for your CUBS presentation.

&nbsp;

### Abstract Formatting Guidelines

First and foremost, a successful abstract will:
1. Establish the motivation for the project or research undertaking (what is the problem? how has the problem been approached previously, and what are limitations to this approach?)
2. Delineate an idea or approach that addresses this issue and previous hurdles other approaches have attempted.
3. Note certain applications of your study or research, and if applicable, future steps you will take to further your research that you would like to highlight. 

Before submitting, also ensure your abstract meets the following requirements:
* Abstracts are limited to a maximum of 150 words. We strongly recommend abstracts are at least 100 words. 
* Abstracts may be submitted individually, or on behalf of a group or team; if the latter is the case, please make sure to note so accordingly on the Google Form and have a main point of contact submit the abstract for your team. 
* The abstract should be submitted as a PDF, with **12-point Arial font and 1-inch margins (150 word limit)**.
