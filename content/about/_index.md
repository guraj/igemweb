### Hello! We are iGEM at Berkeley.

![iGEM at Berkeley Retreat](/images/about/retreat.jpg "iGEM at Berkeley")

We're UC Berkeley's only hands-on genetic engineering club for undergraduates.
Our mission is to provide undergraduates with the unique opportunity to perform original, student-led genetic engineering research projects. By building each studentâ€™s technical skillset, ability to work as a team, and passion in synthetic biology research, iGEM at Berkeley seeks to increase accessibility of the synthetic biology community to students of all backgrounds and research experience levels at Cal.
