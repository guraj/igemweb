Our Genomics team will have the opportunity to research and work on a novel problem of the team's choice in genomics. We will be developing tools or analyses for applications in one of the subfields of clinical methods for biomarker identification, viral genomics, single-cell analysis, or metagenomics profiling. We will also be learning new methodologies, analyzing the pros and cons, and ideating how to approach various factors of applications.
