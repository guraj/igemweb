Our project focuses on creating a faster and more efficient way to perform traditional cloning methods. As opposed to traditional plasmid assembly methods that are performed in vitro, we aim to create a method that negates the need for plating in-between assembly steps. It utilizes a CRISPR system to assemble plasmids and a conjugation system to transfer plasmids in-between assembly steps. In the lab, we are preprogramming cut sites and studying complementation genes so Clonebot Assembly will be able to assemble genetic parts in vivo.
