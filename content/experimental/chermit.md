The CheRMiT team is developing a pipeline for mining and processing chemical reactions from millions of papers published in scientific literature. A complete resource will not only provide curated information on thousands of enzymatic reactions for researchers to use, but may also assist in making predictions about undocumented reactions. Team members focus on developing state-of-the-art methods in language processing via machine learning.
