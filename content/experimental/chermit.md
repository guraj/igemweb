Manually updating and curating data on reactions from scientific literature is difficult and involves human curation. 

Our project integrates methods in language processing, cheminformatics, and machine learning to automate this process and ensure valid chemical reactions are being extracted. Together, we are building a pipeline for mining and processing chemical reactions from millions of papers published in scientific literature. A complete resource will not only provide curated information on thousands of enzymatic reactions for researchers to use, but may also assist in making predictions about undocumented reactions.
