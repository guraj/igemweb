Fungal contamination of soft cheeses, such as feta, poses a significant problem for organic cheese farms, resulting in major economic losses, potential health hazards from fungal mycotoxins, and quality reduction due to unnatural odors and flavors. Our project focuses on inhibiting the growth of Penicillium commune, a common cause of cheese spoilage, on feta cheese through recombinant chitinase expression in Lactococcus lactis and exploring its industrial applications. Our team is currently working on constructing and transforming shuttle vectors containing our chitinase gene of interest into L. lactis, refining a secretion signaling system, and developing assays that will determine the antifungal activities of our engineered chassis.
