description : "iGEM at Berkeley was originally founded around a number of project teams 
primarily rooted in two spheres: wetlab engineering and computational biology. Today, iGEM at Berkeley has 7 experimental teams, each team distinct in its goal and exploration of biology through multifaceted approaches and collaborations. Weâ€™re always looking for new project ideas to incubate and turn into experimental teams!"
