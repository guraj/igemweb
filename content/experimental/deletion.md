The Clonebot Deletion team’s mission is to develop a more efficient way to knockout genes in bacteria. To do so, we are focusing on designing and cloning our way to a one-step plasmid system that cuts, trims, ligates, and self-clears with great accuracy using CRISPR-Cas12a. Currently, we are conducting proof-of-concept experiments involving Golden Gate assemblies and fluorescence-based assays, but we hope to eventually demonstrate our system’s proficiency at cleanly deleting targeted genes.
