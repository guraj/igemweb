Our team focuses on de novo protein design. We are interested in designing scaffolds for enzymatic active sites that support catalytic activity (i.e., we want our hallucinated proteins to be capable of the same catalytic function as the native enzyme). Changing scaffolds allows us to design protein for greater stability, higher binding affinity,  and favorable enzymatic functionality. The designs will be generated computationally using RosettaDesign and AlphaFold, and eventually tested in the wet lab.
