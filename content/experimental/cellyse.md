Cellyse aims to implement an antibody-inducible system of cell lysis in a bacterium in hopes of increasing accessibility and affordability to antibody diagnostics. Our system utilizes the T4 phage cell lysis mechanism and a visible color change to clearly indicate the presence of a specific antibody in a non-invasive saliva sample. Currently, we are modeling lytic proteins to identify regions where we can insert epitope sequences, and are exploring the use of inducible promoters for detection of chemicals of interest.
