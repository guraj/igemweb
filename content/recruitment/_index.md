### Apply to our Experimental or New Ideas Teams!

> We have several wetlab engineering and computational biology teams, each dedicated to addressing a distinct biological research question. Our experimental teams continue work on well-defined projects, while our new ideas teams focus on exploring novel research areas. Joining iGEM at Berkeley helps build your technical skillset, ability to work as a team, and passion in bioengineering research. Regardless of your experience level, check out [our teams](https://igem.berkeley.edu/experimental/) and consider [applying to an Experimental or New Ideas Team today](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4kUSmc6TNFonkDwzAppapGv4q64xXsdXETc97yCoA8jOfSA/viewform?usp=sf_link) before applications close **January 28, 2023 at 11:59 p.m.**.

### Apply to our lab DeCal!

> This spring, we're also offering a lab-based introduction to synthetic biology through a 2-unit DeCal called Foundations of Engineering Biology II (FERB II). If you enroll, you will be guided through a basic molecular cloning workflow. The prerequisites for FERB II are any of the following: FERB I (Fall), BIO 1A, AP Biology, or knowledge of (synthetic) biology fundamentals. There are 16 open spots and the preferred application deadline is **January 28 at 11:59 p.m.**. However, applications will be accepted until **February 1 at 11:59 p.m.** Read the full syllabus [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJ8pMN8HI_zcxHgnUkGoMCL51Dhj33qfQU97YQUMiXc/edit) and apply to the DeCal using [this form](https://bit.ly/3Xl4oek).
