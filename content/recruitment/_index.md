### Apply to our Experimental or Ideation Teams!

> **Thank you for your interest, but unfortunately our applications have closed for the Fall 2023 semester. Please check back in Spring 2024.**

> We have several wetlab engineering and computational biology teams, each dedicated to addressing a distinct biological research question. Our experimental teams continue work on well-defined projects, while our ideation teams focus on exploring novel research areas. Joining iGEM at Berkeley helps build your technical skillset, ability to work as a team, and passion in bioengineering research. Regardless of your experience level, [check out our teams](/teams) and consider [applying to an Experimental or Ideation Team today](https://forms.gle/c4TgnW8mzwJ5iUWt8) before applications close **September 4, 2023 at 11:59 p.m.**

&nbsp;

### Apply to our DeCals: FERB I and FERB II

> This fall, we're offering both **Foundations of Engineering Biology (FERB) I**, a fundamental introduction to synthetic and computational biology, as well as **FERB II**, a lab-based introduction to synthetic biology that guides you through a basic molecular cloning workflow. 

> FERB I has no prerequisites. The prerequisites for FERB II are any of the following: FERB I (Fall), BIO 1A, AP Biology, or knowledge of (synthetic) biology fundamentals.

> FERB I has 30 open spots and FERB II has 10 open spots. The preferred application deadline is **September 2 at 11:59 p.m.**. However, applications will be accepted until **September 4 at 11:59 p.m**. [Learn more about our DeCals and read their full syllabi here](https://igem.berkeley.edu/ferb).
