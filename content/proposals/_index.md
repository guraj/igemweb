### Got an idea in bioengineering, genomics, computational biology, or the like?

With lab space, low-overhead access to lab reagents and compute resources, and vibrant culture with diverse mentorship, iGEM at Berkeley is looking to field, incubate, and fund new student-proposed projects for the Fall 2022 semester and beyond. If you have a challenge you want to tackle in the field, anywhere from climate and environment to healthcare and therapeutics, consider bringing your vision to our community.

> Proposals are due by August 24th, but will be accepted on a rolling deadline (and we encourage you to submit earlier to get feedback and *revise + resubmit*. To submit an idea for consideration, [here's a template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VeQEkzU3hwnEroIRoO_Et6tXeI2wC1ijLGaIsxKu59o/edit) you should copy and fill out to ensure we have enough information on your proposal to support it!
>
> Here are a few things that you'll need to specify on the form to ensure you have a successful proposal:

1. Some explanation of the background of your idea, and how what you're proposing might contribute to that work!
2. A graduate student or postdoc that will mentor and provide advice on your project. Mentors are great sources of encouragement and feedback, and can help ensure your ideas are feasible!
3. A rough timeline for your project, as well as an initial summary of the resources, wetlab or computational, that you will expect your experiments to use
