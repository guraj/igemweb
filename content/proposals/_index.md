### Got an idea in bioengineering, genomics, computational biology, or the like?

With lab space, low-overhead access to lab reagents and compute resources, and vibrant culture with diverse mentorship, iGEM at Berkeley is looking to field, incubate, and fund new student-proposed projects for the Fall 2022 semester and beyond. If you have a challenge you want to tackle in the field, anywhere from climate and environment to healthcare and therapeutics, consider bringing your vision to our community.
