### Our Mission

We're always striving to make bioengineering research more accessible and exciting for undergrads. This means that all majors and experience levels are welcome! We understand that everyone comes in with different areas of knowledge and levels of experience, but we hope that all members in our organization will grow and develop the skills necessary to contribute to meaningful research.

### Directors

iGEM at Berkeley's undergraduate directors work to help connect UC Berkeley's budding bioengineering researchers and foster a  hub for student-driven projects and cohesive collaboration.
