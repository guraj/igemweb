### iGEM at Berkeley continually collaborates with industry and academia.

Our Outreach Team coordinates, plans, and hosts events, like [Breaking into Biosciences](/bib/), graduate student panels, and industry info sessions. The team also creates graphics and develops iGEM at Berkeley's brand, including this site! And we expand iGEM at Berkeley's network through sponsored recruitment sessions and further efforts with companies and other universities.
