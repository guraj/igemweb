![Speakers](/images/bib/bib-headshots.png "Breaking into Biosciences Speakers")

*Vasudev Bailey, Junko Yano, Blake Riggs, Christopher Barnes, Meghna Gupta*

Please join us for our second event spotlighting success in STEM by people from nontraditional and underrepresented backgrounds. Meet our diverse lineup of speakers and hear them share stories of their personal careers and the barriers they had to overcome as a part of the biosciences community. Learn more about each of our speakers and their backgrounds:

&nbsp;

**Dr. Blake Riggs**     *Pronouns: he/him/his*

Currently an Associate Professor in Cell Molecular Biology at San Francisco State University. It has been a long and difficult road in a toxic training environment that has not always valued diversity and equity in research. My mission is understand the organization of the cell and to train the next generation of diverse scientist to advance our understanding of the cell.

**Dr. Junko Yano**

Junko is a Senior Scientist at the Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division. She is also a PI of the Liquid Sunlight Alliance. Her research areas include the water oxidation in natural photosynthesis and artificial photosynthesis, catalytic reactions in metalloenzymes, application of synchrotron X-ray radiation and X-ray free electron laser techniques to biological and inorganic systems.

1. What inspires you to work in STEM or operations?

I studied STEM because that was the way I could be away, far far away from where I was.
I never thought about pursuing STEM. But here I am...

2. What excites you about your work at Berkeley Lab?

The collaborative environment. I get wonderful expert knowledge through the network of people.

3. How can our country engage more women, girls, and members of other underrepresented groups in STEM or operations?

Giving them the right idea that you don't need to be a super person to pursue your career.

4. Do you have tips you would recommend for someone looking to enter your field of work?

I would say, I am doing it, so you can do it!

5. When you have free time, what are your hobbies?

Jogging, Knitting, Painting, Reading, and Watching Ninjago with my daughter.

**Dr. Vasudev Bailey**

Vasudev Bailey, PhD, is a GP/Senior Partner at ARTIS Ventures where he focuses on investing in novel and breakthrough health and life sciences companies. He currently sits on 10 boards, including Eko, Excision, Outpace, Unnatural Products, Glyphic Bio, Seed Health, Association for Women in Sciences (AWIS), Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering, and The Trevor Project, and is an investor in Freenome, Cerebral, ONI, Cartography, Siren, Science, Lemonaid Health and Climax Foods, and has helped incubate Replay and FIG. He is the founder of the ARTIS Ventures Healthcare Pioneers, which brings together some of the world’s brightest minds to accelerate and incubate life-changing ideas in healthcare.

Prior to joining ARTIS, Vasudev co-founded the GLG Institute—the world's largest network of C-Suite executives. Here, he worked with C-suite executives from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Teva, McDonald’s, and others to build a forum to connect retired executives with aspiring leaders. He previously served as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company.

Vasudev received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering (the use of nanotechnology and epigenetics for personalized chemotherapy and early cancer detection), from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where he was recognized as both a Siebel and a Medtronic Scholar and member of Sigma Xi. He graduated magna cum laude and phi beta kappa from UC Irvine with a degree in biomedical engineering, and was both a Regents Scholar, Hodson Foundation fellow, Whitaker Foundation Fellow, and Henri Samueli Endowed Scholar.

Vasudev has published over 30+ scientific papers/abstracts and holds four provisional patents from his research in nanotechnology for the early detection of cancer. He has been recognized as one of the world’s leading biomedical engineers by the Siebel Foundation. He also was recognized as SF Times 40 under 40.

He has spoken on the topic of biotech, healthcare, and entrepreneurism at events including SALT, DTx West, Health 2.0, GIANT Health, Johns Hopkins Research Symposium on Engineering in Healthcare, AWIS Summit, and East/West CEO, and has been a distinguished guest lecturer at UC Irvine, Johns Hopkins and UCL. He has been quoted as an expert on biotech and healthcare in CNBC, Venture Capital Journal, HIT Consultant, Startupedia, and more.

**Dr. Christopher Barnes**      *Pronouns: he/him/his*

Dr. Christopher Barnes is a native North Carolinian who earned dual degrees in Chemistry and Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and completed his PhD at the University of Pittsburgh. It was during his doctoral work that Dr. Barnes became interested in using structural tools to understand the complexity of macromolecular interactions. With this newfound training, he completed postdoctoral research at Caltech, where he combined structural methods with in vivo approaches to understand how viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, infect host cells and elicit specific humoral immune responses. Now, the Barnes laboratory investigates viral-host interactions and translates structural knowledge of antibody-antigen interactions into the rational development of highly protective antibodies and vaccines.

**Dr. Meghna Gupta**        *Pronouns: she/her/hers*

I never thought I would be so passionate about research as none of my family members are from biosciences or research and I am the first PhD in the family. I followed my career path as it carved itself and I am glad I did. As an international postdoc, there were many challenges, but determination is the key to keep going.
