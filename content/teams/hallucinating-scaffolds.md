Hallucinating scaffolds team aims to design functional de novo proteins by taking active sites of an enzyme and hallucinating, i.e. computationally generating, scaffolds for enzymatic active sites such that the generated de novo proteins are capable of the same catalytic activity as the native enzyme. The designs will be generated using Rosetta-based tools and deep learning, and the structures will be analyzed in the aspect of properties and catalytic functions. Eventually the best candidates will be tested in the wet lab.
