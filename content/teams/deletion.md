Generating efficient gene knockouts in bacteria is a crucial component of many synthetic biology projects. Since current gene knockout methods are often time consuming and technically challenging, our Deletion team is focused on developing novel alternatives. We are currently running a 3-step experiment to synthesize a plasmid that is inducible by the Tet expression system and that utilizes CRISPR-Cas12a to perform gene deletions. We are looking for members who are willing to commit time to wet lab experiments and are interested in the cloning process!
