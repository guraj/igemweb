The Peptide Design Team’s goal is to better understand how to use computational techniques to study and design proteins and peptides. The ability to design novel peptides for a specific purpose has many potential therapeutic applications, such as blocking certain key protein-peptide interactions in a particular disease’s signaling pathway. We want to explore the scientific literature surrounding peptide design, and are specifically interested in developing a clear, easy-to-use pipeline for the computational design of peptide inhibitors for protein-protein interactions.
