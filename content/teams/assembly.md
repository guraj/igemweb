Traditional plasmid assembly methods (e.g. Golden Gate, Gibson) are performed *in vitro*, requiring many intermediate steps. Our team utilizes a CRISPR system to construct DNA parts *in vivo*, resulting in a faster and more efficient way to perform DNA assembly. We are presently optimizing double transformation of indicator and editor plasmids, as well as testing conjugation of pOX28 plasmids.
