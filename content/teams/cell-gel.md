Conventionally, genetically-engineered *E. coli* are cultured in liquid media. The Cell Gel Ideation team is designing an optimized hydrogel or polymeric biomaterial matrix as semi-solid phase media to boost biomanufacturing efficiency. The new media's structure and molecular properties will serve to immobilize cells within the gel, allowing the cells to proliferate and metabolize at a higher rate and at a cheaper cost compared to traditional bioreactors.
